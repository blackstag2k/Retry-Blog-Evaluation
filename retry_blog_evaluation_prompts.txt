1. readability_score:
   - Sentence clarity
   - Grammar and fluency
   - Ease of understanding for a general audience
   - Logical sentence flow

2. content_structure_score:
   - Logical progression of ideas
   - Paragraph organization
   - Use of headings or implicit structure
   - Coherence and flow between sections

3. engagement_score:
   - Ability to maintain reader interest
   - Tone and relatability
   - Hooks, examples, or persuasive elements
   - Overall reader involvement

CSV Output Format (STRICT):
